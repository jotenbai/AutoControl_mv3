# AutoControl MV3 — RCM/LCM Bug on Chrome 150

**Date:** 2026-08-02. **Status: SOLVED (v6+v7)** — LCM no longer sticks after a gesture (v6, block softening under key 1026), the context menu after a gesture is closed by auto-Esc (v7, `RBTN_ESC_DELAY_MS=50`; works even with 1 ms).

## Issue #1 follow-up (2026-08-30): "right click menu override not working"

**Report (github issue #1):** with a trigger "RMB → action, block mode 'up'" the action fires but the context menu still appears. Export: `triggers:[{combins:[{block:2,eventId:2,wildcard:2}]}]`.

**Root cause:** the 2026-08-30 strip update softened EVERY `block:true` under key 1026 — including the USER's own block-up entry (`1026→{type:0,block:true,preconds:[{type:8,value:1,actIdx}]}` — actionDone-gated), which is what makes the native swallow the RMB release so the menu stays closed. Softening it let the menu open after every right-click action.

**Fix (v6.2):** the strip is now SELECTIVE — soften ONLY gesture-preset entries (mouseGestState precond, `type:11`) and preserve the user's actionDone-gated block entries.

**Verified live (Chrome 150, real OS RMB injection):**
- RMB → NO menu (page receives ZERO `mousedown/mouseup/contextmenu` events — the native swallows the whole click), trigger fires (pinTabs), LMB after RMB works, no spontaneous re-fires (16s idle), gestures' 1026 block still softened.
- mouseOver (hover) conditions are a separate NATIVE regression on Chrome 150 (see below).

**Also confirmed live:** the type-60 config chain works (the earlier "stale config" confusion was `Runtime.consoleAPICalled` REPLAYING the SW console backlog on debugger attach — hooks (`_Lk`/`_mh`/`_acNativeSend`) proved the live sends contain the current storage data).

### Hover-region conditions broken on Chrome 148+ (native, NOT the port)

2026-08-30 verification: a RMB trigger with `preconds:{mouseOver:[{region:4}]}` ("Title area") AND with `region:3` ("Web page") fired EVERYWHERE (page AND tab strip) — the native ignores `{type:14}` mouseOver preconds entirely (a11y hit-test regression). Affects MV2 and MV3 equally (same native; the user's Edge/MV2 test works because Edge's a11y differs). No extension-side workaround (no cursor-position API). Do NOT promise hover conditions as working on Chrome 148+.

## Symptoms (original, before the fix)

1. The right-button gesture worked (trail + action).
2. RCM worked with the soften filter: the context menu opened (incl. omnibox/tabs).
3. **After a gesture, LCM was globally blocked** — clicks did not pass through in Chrome NOR in OTHER windows, until one RCM click (which resets the native state).

## Cause

The imported user config generates entries for key 2 (RCM) in type 60:

```
2→{type:0,block:true,...}                          // global RCM block
2→{type:4,state:true,timeout:1500,block:true,...}  // gesture begin (required!)
2→{type:6,actIdx,preconds:[RCM...]}                // trigger registration
```

On Chrome 150 the native is incorrect with these entries (a native bug, not ours).

## Observations (all verified)

| Config | RCM | Gesture | LCM after gesture |
|---|---|---|---|
| `block:true` (original) | dead (omnibox/tabs/repeats) from the first click | works | ok |
| `block:false` (soften) | works | works | **sticks globally until an RCM click** |
| type:0/type:4 entries removed | works | **does not work** (begin required) | ok |
| fresh install (default) | ok | (gestures apparently disabled — no key-2 entries) | ok |

Other:
- An identical re-send of type 60 does not heal (native skips byte-identical configs).
- A CHANGED config (settings toggle) "heals" the RCM stick for a long time, but returning `block:true` restores the bug (re-registration does not help).
- `type 40(false)` after a gesture — no-op. `type 40(true)+40(false)` — **makes it worse** (LCM stops working entirely) → reverted.

## Current code state (`../mv3-build/sw.js`) — FIX v6+v7, 2026-08-02 (WORKS)

- `STRIP_RBTN_BLOCK = true` (v6): in `postMsg()` for type 60 every entry of key 2 **and key 1026** (RCM-up, `2|_mk`) with `block` gets `block:false`. **Confirmed by the user: LCM no longer sticks after a gesture** (`softened 3 block entries (key 2/1026)`, dump shows `1026→{"type":0,"block":false,...}`).
- **v7 (auto-Esc) — confirmed**: after a gesture (type 750) `RBTN_ESC_DELAY_MS`=**50 ms** later a synthetic Esc `postMsg(_Dt=300, [27, 1051])` (Esc down+up) is sent — the context menu does not open/gets closed. User verified: works even with 1 ms, kept 50 ms.
- **Gesture detection** (so Esc does not fire after hotkeys): `data.mouseGest` OR type 760 (raw gesture stream) within `GESTURE_WINDOW_MS`=2000 ms before the 750.
- v5 (RCM+Esc synth) REMOVED — a synthetic RCM click would land inside the just-opened menu and activate an item.
- Switches: `RBTN_ESC_ENABLE=true`, `RBTN_ESC_DELAY_MS=50`, `GESTURE_WINDOW_MS=2000`. v4 config-flip dead (`OBSOLETE_V4=false`).
- Logs: `STRIP_RBTN_BLOCK: softened 3 block entries (key 2/1026)`, `← 750 full data: {…}`, `RBTN-ESC trigger: …`, `RBTN-ESC: sent synth [Esc-down,Esc-up] [27,1051]`.

### Root cause (confirmed by file25.js/file3.js analysis)

The `block:true` entries under key 2 do NOT come from keyEvt-preconds of volume triggers (those are disabled). They are generated by **the gesture preset itself** `_Bh(_md)` (file3.js `_Vi.rightButton`): `begin: {eventId:2, block:true}` → inside `_mh`'s function `R()` the `M||V` branch (`r.type==_mp && r.state` for begin) creates `n(e.eventId,{type:_Th,block:!0},...)` → type:0 block:true under key 2. A fresh install with default gestures does NOT break RCM → the difference is exactly the global block under key 2 (absent in the default).

## Experiments tried (results)

1. Auto re-send of config after 2 s (identical) — did not help.
2. RBTN_HEAL (soften → original after 2 s/600 ms) — did not help (final block:true is dead).
3. remove (deleting type:0/type:4 for key 2) — gestures broke.
4. `40(false)` after a gesture — no-op.
5. `40(true)+40(false)` after a gesture — made it worse, reverted.
6. **Config-flip after a gesture (v4)** — FAILED: the flip executed (logs confirmed) but LCM stayed locked. Hook re-registration does not reset the internal "RCM held" flag in native. Reason: block:true under key 1026 (RCM-up) was not touched.
7. **RCM-click+Esc synth via type 300 (v5)** — FAILED/did not fire: no `RBTN-HEAL trigger` in the 01:21 log (mouseGest absent or gesture not in the log). Idea suggested by the user: "add synthetic RCM+Esc input to the action". Replaced by v7 (Esc only).
8. **Block softening under key 1026 (v6)** — **WORKS**: LCM does not stick after a gesture. Side effect: context menu after a gesture.
9. **Auto-Esc after a gesture (v7, current)** — implemented; confirmed working. Gesture detection: `mouseGest` or type 760 within 2 s before the 750.

## Fix verification

**CONFIRMED (2026-08-02):** RCM gesture → LCM works immediately, the context menu does not open. `RBTN_ESC_DELAY_MS=50` (works even with 1 ms). In the SW log:
- At startup: `STRIP_RBTN_BLOCK: softened 3 block entries (key 2/1026)`; dump shows `1026→` with `"block":false`.
- At a gesture: `← 760 …` (raw gesture stream), `RBTN-ESC trigger: …`, ~50 ms later `RBTN-ESC: sent synth [Esc-down,Esc-up] [27,1051]` + `→ synth type 300 payload: [27,1051]`.

Backup options (not needed): double Esc, larger delay, manual "Synthesize input" with Esc in the gesture action.

## Untested ideas (backup, if v7 fails)

- The user can remove "block" from RCM triggers in the settings (the source of the entries) — then the filter is not needed; verify gestures still work (untested).
- Upstream: report to the AutoControl author — native right-button bug on Chrome 150.
- If a manual RCM click heals but the synth does not: try `RBTN_HEAL_DELAY_MS` (the synth may fire too early, before the gesture action completes).
- If the synth breaks subsequent gestures (RCM-down synth read as a new gesture start): add type 315 (`_be`) input lock during the synth — `[2, 1026]` under the lock will not start gesture recognition.

## Reference

- Key 2 = RCM (`_md`). mapKey = eventId + 22025 (22027 = key 2).
- User's gesture trigger: actIdx 38/40/44 (varies), its compilation produces type:0 + type:4 + type:6.
